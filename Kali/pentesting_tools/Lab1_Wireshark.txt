This is my first kali lab


 This example was done using http://example.com
learn OSI model mapping

OSI layer               protocols          example
7 Application layer     DNS, HTTP           GET/HTTP/1.1
4 – Transport           TCP handshake       SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK
3 – Network             IP addresses        10.2X1.173.XX - 93.184.216.34
2 – Data Link            Ethernet frames    frame headers


I set up 3 labs, Kali, Ubuntu and windows all in VM. The communicated with each other.
day 3 of learning.
Dns lookup - handshake -http (s) communication

all learnt using wireshark to show eacg stage of the OSI model.

step 1 = DNS resolution
step 2 = tcp handshake
step 3 = http req & res
step 4 = Tls handshake
