Symmetric encryption = same key for lock/unlock (e.g., AES).
	•	Asymmetric encryption = public key (share) + private key (keep secret).
	•	Hashing = one-way, for integrity (e.g., SHA-256).
	•	TLS = uses both: asymmetric for exchanging the session key, symmetric for actual communication.

Ran a vuln scan on Kali usimg nmap to scan ubuntu, I discovered CVE-2001-1002
NAMED AVAHI NULL UDP PACKET DOS
step 1: I scan for vuln
step 2: I analyze the CVE
--- DoS, medium severity, not critical
STEP 3: Remediate: disable Avahi
step 4: verify, rescan to verify mitigation

Today I practiced vulnerability scanning between my Kali and Ubuntu VMs. Using Nmap, 
I found that Ubuntu was running the Avahi service on UDP port 5353, and the scan flagged it as vulnerable to CVE-2011-1002 (a null UDP packet DoS).

I tested this by sending an empty UDP packet from Kali using both hping3 and netcat.
The first time, the VM actually shut down after receiving the packet — a full denial of service, which shows how a small crafted packet can impact availability. 
Later tests didn’t crash the service, which led me to dig deeper.

On Ubuntu, I checked the Avahi package changelog and confirmed that the CVE was patched in newer versions. 
This explained why the exploit didn’t always work. It was a great reminder that vulnerability scans can show false positives if the system is already patched.

Learnt:
Scanning is just the first step. 
You always need to validate findings, test carefully, and confirm with system updates or changelogs. 
Patching or disabling unnecessary services (like Avahi) is the best way to reduce risk.
---------------------------------------
commands used for vuln scanning:
# Scan all ports and detect versions
nmap -sV -p- <Ubuntu_IP>

# Run vulnerability scan with NSE scripts
nmap --script vuln <IP>

-------------------------------------
# Check listening UDP ports
ss -ulnp | grep 5353

# Check Avahi daemon status
systemctl status avahi-daemon

# Get Avahi version
avahi-daemon --version
--------------------------
# Send a single null UDP packet (requires root)
sudo hping3 -2 -c 1 -p 5353 <IP>

# Alternative method with netcat (no root needed)
echo -n "" | nc -u <IP> 5353

--------------------------------
# Restart Avahi daemon after crash
sudo systemctl restart avahi-daemon

# Disable Avahi if not needed
sudo systemctl stop avahi-daemon
sudo systemctl disable avahi-daemon

# Update all packages (includes patched Avahi)
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Confirm CVE patch in package changelog
apt changelog avahi-daemon | grep CVE-2011-1002

Cryptosystems use a set of procedures known as cryptographic algorithms, or ciphers, 
to encrypt and decrypt messages to secure communications among computer systems, devices and applications.
