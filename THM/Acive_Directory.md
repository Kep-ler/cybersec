Hands-on-Lab learning of Active Directory


Domain Controller (DC) → The server that runs AD and stores authentication/authorization data.
	•	Objects → Users, groups, computers, printers, etc. managed by AD.
	•	Organizational Units (OUs) → Containers that group objects for easier management.
	•	Group Policy (GPO) → Rules that apply configurations and restrictions to users/computers.
	•	Kerberos Authentication → Protocol AD uses to authenticate securely.
	•	Trust Relationships → Allowing different domains/forests to share resources.


 Identity & Access Management (IAM) → AD is a real-world implementation of IAM.
	•	Principle of Least Privilege → AD enforces (or fails to enforce) this.
	•	Single Sign-On (SSO) → Implemented through AD + Kerberos.
	•	Threats & Mitigations → Pass-the-Hash, Golden Ticket, Kerberoasting, etc. (often appear in Security+ and real jobs).
